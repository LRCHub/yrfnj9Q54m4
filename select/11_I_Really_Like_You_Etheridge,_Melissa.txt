I'll buy you mangos baby
Your favorite fruit
I'll shave everything baby
I'll press my suit
I'll find that song by Perry Como you like to sing
I'll eat your tv dinners
And wear your cigar ring
Do you think that I can persuade
Don't make me fade because

CHORUS:
I really like you baby
I want to see you baby
I really like you baby
I want to be you baby

I'll gladly make you
My first tattoo
You and me forever
In red and black and blue
I'll let you drive my car
I'll even paint my eyes
Forget about all my friends
And tell outrageous lies
Do you think I can persuade
Don't make me fade because

CHORUS
