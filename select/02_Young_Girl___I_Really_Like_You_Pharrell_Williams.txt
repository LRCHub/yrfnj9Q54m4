(You know)
(you know listen to me)
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl
(thats true, so true)
(you're the only girl I love to)
My heart was soaken and I broken in a young world
(so true, so true, listen)
I wasn't tryin to lead her on
See I didn't wanna be alone
But when she smiles she braught me home
So I braught her home,
Its not that the fealin of love is gone
Can't expect a kind little girl to be grown
I can't give a fuck what so and so says
Crushes hurt both ways
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
My heart was soaken and I broken in a young world!
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young
Young girl, so in love with you
The single girls are out tonight
But you have one word, my heart, one life
And I'm not lookin around
So why you lookin down
(what you lookin down for?)
I fucked up a long time ago
See I should have never let you know
See I couldnt give a fuck what tabloids say
(as the people magazine)
And crushes hurt both ways
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do (HOV!)
My heart was soaken and I broken in a young world!
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do (HOV!)
Young girl, so in love with you (HOV!)
[Jay-Z]
HOV got a young girl
HOV got a young girl
Still not quite 21
So high strung
Such a vibrant thing
I introduce myself, hi miss thing
You're 19?
No, you're lighting in a bottle I give you a ring tomorrow
The scene that follows
Screens of horror
Classic Steven King novel
Mamma don't think you should take someone so advanced in romance
You should just wait
Pappa don't preach
HOV don't bite
Hopin throught it I might mo your life
'cause ima show you right
Proper etiquette how to hold your knife
Keep it competetive with Oprah's ice
Be like Janet, take control of your life
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(young girl)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do (young girl)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(young girl)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
(young girl)
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(to young, I'm never to young)
Young girl, so in love with you
('cause I'm never to young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(to young, I'm never to young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
('cause I'm never to young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(to young, I'm never to young)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
('cause I'm never to young!)
My heart was soaken and I broken in a young world!
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
(this is where the story begins baby)
